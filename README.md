### Hi there! I'm Tyler 👾

🚀About Me🚀
I am a former chemistry major who decided to transition into the field of tech. I have experience with Full Stack Development specializing in web development.
I love to program with simple and effective solutions, I always enjoy learning something new and then applying it to what I already know. I strive for efficiency, I won't stop until I understand exactly what I'm tasked to do.
Helping others is also a big part of my life, if someone needs help with a problem I WILL help them. If I don't understand their issue I will research and problem-solve until I can give them the best solution I can.
